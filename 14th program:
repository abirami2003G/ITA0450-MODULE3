Make a histogram for the “AirPassengers“dataset, start at 100 on the x-axis, and from 
values 200 to 700, make the bins 200 wide

 program:
 
 # Assuming the "AirPassengers" dataset is available in the datasets package
data(AirPassengers)
subset_data <- subset(AirPassengers, AirPassengers >= 200 & AirPassengers <= 700)
hist(subset_data, 
     breaks = seq(100, 700, 200), 
     xlim = c(100, 700), 
     main = "Histogram of AirPassengers", 
     xlab = "Values")
