Create a Boxplot graph for the relation between "mpg"(miles per galloon) and 
"cyl"(number of Cylinders) for the dataset "mtcars" available in R Environment


 program:
 
 # Load the mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)

# Create a boxplot
boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars,
        main = "Boxplot of mpg by number of cylinders",
        xlab = "Number of cylinders",
        ylab = "Miles per gallon")
