i) Find the car which gives maximum city miles per gallon
ii) Find the cars which gives minimum disp in compact and subcompact class

 coding:
 # Load the ggplot2 library (for the mpg dataset)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the mpg dataset
data(mpg)

# Find the car which gives maximum city miles per gallon
max_cty_car <- mpg[which.max(mpg$cty), "model"]

# Print the result
cat("The car which gives maximum city miles per gallon is", max_cty_car, "\n")

# Find the cars which gives minimum disp in compact and subcompact classes
min_disp_cars <- mpg[mpg$class %in% c("compact", "subcompact"),]
min_disp_cars <- min_disp_cars[min_disp_cars$disp == min(min_disp_cars$disp), "model"]

# Print the result
cat("The cars which give minimum disp in compact and subcompact classes are", paste(min_disp_cars, collapse = ", "), "\n")
